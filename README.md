 Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)
Project Overview
This project implements an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system using image processing and machine learning techniques. The objective is to detect and extract vehicle license plates from images or videos.

Dataset
The dataset consists of images of vehicles with labeled license plates for training and validation.

Approach
Image Preprocessing: Noise removal, grayscale conversion, and edge detection.
License Plate Detection: Using contour detection and bounding box techniques.
Character Recognition: Applying OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text from detected plates.
Technologies Used
Python (Jupyter Notebook)
OpenCV (for image processing)
Tesseract OCR (for character recognition)
TensorFlow/Keras (if deep learning is used)
Results & Next Steps
Successfully detects license plates in images with good accuracy.
Potential improvements include enhancing OCR accuracy and optimizing real-time detection.
